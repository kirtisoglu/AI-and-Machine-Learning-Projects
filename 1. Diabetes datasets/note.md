  ### Feature Engineering

  We discuss a number of common numeric feature engineering techni‚Äê
  ques, such as quantization, scaling (a.k.a. normalization), log transforms (a type of
  power transform), and interaction features, and gave a summary of feature
  selection techniques, necessary for handling large quantities of interaction features.

  In statistical machine learning, all data eventually boils down to numeric features.
  Therefore, all roads lead to some kind of numeric feature engineering technique at
  the end. Keep these tools handy for the end game of feature engineering!



## HTML code to create a table in markdown format;

<style>
    table,
    th,
    td {
        border: 1px black;
        border-collapse: collapse;
    }
    th,
    td {
        padding: 5px;
    }

    th {text-align: left}
    tr:nth-child(even) {background-color: black; color: white}
    tr:nth-child(odd) {background-color: white; color: black}
    tr:first-child {background-color: green;}
</style>
