About Dataset
Improving healthcare is one of the most promising and meaningful applications of data science. This dataset includes data and NLP-type models, including LLMs, to accomplish a variety of tasks:

sequence to sequence
summarization
q & a
token labeling
text classification
other!
There are three categories of models here:

Large Language Models for healthcare
Transformers tailored for medical applications
LayoutLM transformers for semi-structured documents such as patient forms
The data files are from MedQuAD: the Medical Question Answering Dataset. It's well-suited for use with the models.

I hope you find this dataset useful for language-based exploration in healthcare!
